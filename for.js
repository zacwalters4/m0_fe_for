// As you complete each challenge, RUN THE CODE to ensure it works. You can do this by
// running `node <filepath>`. If you are in this directory, you'd run `node for.js`.

// Challenge 1

// ðŸ“¹ Record yourself live-coding and talking through any ONE of the challenges.
  // The recording doesn't have to be the first time you are solving the problem.
  // Use technical vocabulary and explain each part to demonstrate your understanding!
  // Share the link to your video in your small group channel.
