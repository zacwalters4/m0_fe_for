# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I am quite confident in the usage of the `for` statement.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

It was overall pretty easy as I have used these statements in the past.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

Continuing to refresh my knowledge is the only thing I currently feel like I need to do.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

No current questions!
